## Dataset Inquiries

- **What are the justifications for using each dataset?**
  - OMol
  - Omat24
  - ODAC
  - Matbench
  

- **ODAC availability and access plan:**  
  ODAC does not appear in the official FAIR-Chem dataset catalog  
  (https://fair-chem.github.io/catalysts/datasets/summary) as referenced in the proposal.  
  When following the dataset link (“here”) provided in the  
  [README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/data/odac) or the  
  [project website](https://open-dac.github.io/h), the link returns a **404 error**, indicating that no public dataset distribution is currently available.  
  How is it planned to access this dataset?


- **In-house datasets access:**  
  For the in-house datasets **MOF-DB** and **High Throughput MOFs (HTS MOFs)**, no sources are listed.  
  Are there any ways to access these datasets?
