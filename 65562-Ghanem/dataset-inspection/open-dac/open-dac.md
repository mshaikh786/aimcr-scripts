### ODAC Availability Clarification

ODAC does not appear in the official FAIR-Chem dataset catalog  
(https://fair-chem.github.io/catalysts/datasets/summary) as referenced in the proposal.  
When following the dataset link (“here”) provided in
the [README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/data/odac, or the [website](https://open-dac.github.io/h) the link returns a **404
error**, indicating that no public dataset distribution is currently available.

Despite the absence of a publicly released dataset, ODAC is described in peer-reviewed and preprint literature:

- **ODAC-23:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00341
- **ODAC-25:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03162

These works define the **methodology and data construction** used for topology-driven self-supervised pretraining,
rather than providing a downloadable, catalog-listed dataset comparable to OC20 or OC22.
