## Sample Representation

BlendedMVS is a synthetic multi-view stereo (MVS) dataset used for training and evaluating 3D reconstruction and depth estimation models.

What it contains

- **Multi-view RGB images** of the same scene captured from different virtual camera viewpoints

- **Ground-truth depth** maps for each image

- **Camera parameters** (intrinsics and extrinsics)

- **Scene geometry** derived from rendered 3D models

## Usage Justification

> No proposal justification, or description of intended usage.
