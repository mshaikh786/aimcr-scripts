# Models Mentioned in the Proposal

## Explicitly Named Foundation / LLM Models

Appears in model scaling comparison and performance discussion

- LLaMA 3.2 – 3B
- Qwen 2.5 – 7B Instruct


---

## Project-Specific Models

These are models to be developed or trained within the project:

- ContextFlow (in-context robot foundation model)
- CompoSE (3D asset generation model/system)
- LongVu++ (long-context multimodal video understanding model)
- EfficientRL-Embodied (RL post-training framework/model stage)

---

## Architecture / Model Class References

(Used to describe design, not necessarily deployed as-is)

- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Diffusion Models
- Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
- GPT-style transformer architectures
- Stable Diffusion–like architectures

## External / Benchmark / Dataset-Associated Models

(Referenced for comparison, prior work, or benchmarking)

- Stable Diffusion (2D / 3D variants)
- TripoSG DiT (pretrained initializer)
- VLA / In-context imitation models (general category)
