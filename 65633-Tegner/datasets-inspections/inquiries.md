###  NeMO Portal Filtering Limitations (BICCN Datasets)

Due to the limited and high-level information initially available about the dataset, it was not possible to apply precise filters in the NeMO Data Portal at the outset. Key disambiguating metadata—such as the **exact BICCN grant identifier**, **subspecimen type (Cells vs tissue/nuclei)**, and **assay-level context**—were not specified upfront.

As a result, searches relied on broad terms (e.g., *Mouse*, *BICCN*), which return heterogeneous results spanning multiple modalities, grants, and sample types.
